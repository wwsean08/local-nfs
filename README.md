# local-nfs

An example StatefulSet I created for a block post where I was using the local-storage provisioner in order to store data on an NFS volume.  The NFS Provisioner would be better but I had issues with it so this was my workaround/alternative implementation.

See the blog post [here](https://wwsean08.com/2018/04/using-nfs-with-kubernetes-local-storage-provisioner/)
